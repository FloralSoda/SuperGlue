# SuperGlue
Welcome to the SuperGlue repository. As of right now, SuperGlue is not open source, but the translations and issue tracking are! Here is where you can create pull requests for language translations, or where you can create issues to help track bugs! Feature requests are not accepted at this current time, but they will be on release once I've figured out how I'm gonna manage them.

## Contributing
### Bugs
If you think you've found a bug, please head to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/FloralSoda/SuperGlue/issues) to report it! Further instructions on how to fill out a bug report can be found there. Bad translations reports are also welcome there.
### Features
Feature requests are not yet supported. If you know me personally, you can ask personally, but right now that's all I support while I work out how to distribute workload.
### Translations
Want to add your language? Found an incorrect translation? Create a pull request, or an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/FloralSoda/SuperGlue/issues)

If you're adding a new language, please name it translation_<[locale code]>(https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/i18n/locales.html).csv obeying Godot's locale code scheme. In the future there will be a translation assistant application packaged with the game to help with building a new translation.
